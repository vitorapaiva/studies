Kicking ass and looking intimidating while wearing a frilly, wide-brimmed foppy Victorian aristocrat’s Sunday hat isn’t exactly the easiest thing in the world, but when I guess when you’re one of history’s most pure-blooded badasses you can find a way to make that shit work... especially when you’re packing a silver six-shooter revolver big enough to make Dirty Harry give you a solemn steely-eyed bro-to-bro head nod.  Known as “The Rebel Countess,” Constance Markievicz was an early 20th-century suffragette, writer, poet, revolutionary warrior, sharpshooting instructor, gunslinger, sniper, and political agitator who spent the better part of the 1910s either busting caps at British officers, fistfighting cops, training Irishmen in pistol marksmanship, or performing balls-out acts of civil disobedience that saw her routinely locked up in some of the most horrible prison hellholes the British Isles had to offer.  When she wasn’t serving on the Irish Cabinet or being arrested for disorderly conduct, the Rebel Countess was also a Major in the Irish Republican Army, and her role in the Easter Uprising of 1916 helped kick-start the struggle that broke Ireland away from Great Britain as a separate country.<br>
      <br>
      At one point, the Rebel Countess was sentenced to be executed by firing squad for her role in a particularly bloody Irish uprising against British rule – when she learned that her sentence was going to be commuted to “a lifetime of hard labor” because of her gender, she cursed out the prosecuting attorneys, dared the British to “man up” and shoot her, and then (when they refused) she went out and became the first woman elected to the British House of Commons – a position she was somehow still elected to even while imprisoned for seditious speech against the British government.  Even after she got out of the can Markievicz was so gangster that she never even showed up to take office, abstaining from her elected position out of protest.  Later she went on to be a Cabinet minister in the independent Irish government and spent her spare time fixing racecars and tearing ass around the Emerald Isle in some of the fastest vehicles she could get her hands on, just for the hell of it.<br>
              <br>
      Constance was born in London on February 4, 1868.  Her maiden name was Gore-Booth, which sounds like a small room where people get horribly mutilated, and that’s probably fitting because this woman would go on to kick a lot of ass as a sniper and revolver marksman during one of the most brutal, bitterly-contested conflicts in the history of Western Civilization.  Her family was loaded, and they owned a huge estate in County Sligo, Ireland.  Her pops was a badass arctic explorer so nuts that he has the phrases “polar bear hunting” and “shark fishing” hotlinked in his Wikipedia entry, so you can probably imagine that Constance had a fairly non-traditional upbringing consisting of sucker-punching megafauna in the throat and then displaying their taxidermied corpses prominently in her living room like an awesomely-rad conversation starter.
